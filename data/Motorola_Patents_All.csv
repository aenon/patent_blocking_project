A digital video signal containing a luminance component in Y color space is processed by increasing the amplitude of the luminance data in accordance with a nonlinear transfer function. As a result, low-amplitude components of the luminance signal are reduced. Subsequent quantization errors in transform coefficients produced by a spatial compression routine in a video encoder are consequently reduced. Inverse operations are performed at a video decoder to recover the original luminance data. The invention reduces quantization noise which is manifested particularly as dust-like variations in luminance intensity in an otherwise darkened region of a video image.",Reduction of noise visibility in a digital video system,,23

If the photo-voltage exceeds the reference voltage, a global code value is latched into the pixel data buffer. The optical power falling on the photo-detector is determined from the latched code value. An array of sensors is incorporated into a semiconductor device together with circuitry to read and decode the pixel data buffers.

5292,8918662,utility,8918662,US,2014-12-23,"In embodiments of system timeout reset based on media detection, an electronic device includes an interface connection that couples the electronic device to a peripheral. A power manager application is implemented to timeout the interface connection if user interaction with the electronic device is not detected for a timeout duration. A media data monitor is implemented to detect audio data in an audio channel of the interface connection, and initiate a reset of the timeout duration responsive to the audio data being detected. Video can continue to be rendered by the peripheral if the audio data is detected to initiate the reset of the timeout duration.",System timeout reset based on media detection,B2,18
5293,8923167,utility,8923167,US,2014-12-30,"A communication device reduces intermodulation interference in a simultaneous transmitter using a notch diplexing arrangement. The communication device has a radio front-end module with more than one transceiver for simultaneous transmission with opposing transmit (Tx) band notch filters in series with each duplexer output, and phase rotations into and out of the notch filters suitable for diplexing at the notch filter outputs.",Communication device for simultaneous transmission by multiple transceivers,B2,14
5294,8923321,utility,8923321,US,2014-12-30,"A base station (103) assigns a set of mobile stations (101) to a group wherein the group will share a set of radio resources (710). A shared control channel information element (501) is sent to the group of mobile stations (101) and provides a bitmap having fields for group ordering (511), resource allocations (530), failure handling resources (540), and an ordering pattern (513). If a mobile station fails to decode the shared control channel information element (501) it will access the failure handling resources in order to receive data. The failure handling channel may be persistent in some embodiments, or may be released after the mobile station is once again able to decode the shared control channel information element (501) and thereby share in the shared resource pool allocated to its mobile station group.",Apparatus and method for handling control channel reception/decoding failure in a wireless VoIP communication system,B2,20
5295,8923778,utility,8923778,US,2014-12-30,"A method and system provides an automatic frequency correction (AFC) within a wireless communication device. A synchronization controller estimates first and second frequency errors respectively associated with a first received signal corresponding to a first receiver path and a second received signal corresponding to a second receiver path. The synchronization controller determines a value and a type of target clock of a first AFC associated with the first frequency error. If the first AFC is not generated to target a shared clock such as a reference clock, the synchronization controller generates a second AFC to compensate for the second frequency error. However, if it is determined that the first AFC targets a shared clock, the synchronization controller generates the second AFC to compensate for the first AFC and the second frequency error. The synchronization controller synchronously applies the first and second AFCs to the relevant clocks.",Method for automatic frequency correction in a multi-carrier communications device,B2,20
5296,8924200,utility,8924200,US,2014-12-30,"A method for decoding an audio signal in a decoder having a CELP-based decoder element including a fixed codebook component, at least one pitch period value, and a first decoder output, wherein a bandwidth of the audio signal extends beyond a bandwidth of the CELP-based decoder element. The method includes obtaining an up-sampled fixed codebook signal by up-sampling the fixed codebook component to a higher sample rate, obtaining an up-sampled excitation signal based on the up-sampled fixed codebook signal and an up-sampled pitch period value, and obtaining a composite output signal based on the up-sampled excitation signal and an output signal of the CELP-based decoder element, wherein the composite output signal includes a bandwidth portion that extends beyond a bandwidth of the CELP-based decoder element.",Audio signal bandwidth extension in CELP-based speech coder,B2,8
